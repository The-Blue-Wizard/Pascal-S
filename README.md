Historical archive of Pascal-S compiler as described in a PDF.

I extracted and cleaned up the source code and saved it in pascals.txt

The document indirectly shows that it actually requires a full-blown Pascal compiler...actually a platform-dependent Pascal compiler as it uses "segmented file" thing on a CDC computer.
